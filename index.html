    <h2>Agile in Leeds Jan 2019</h2>
    <p>I went to Agile in Leeds on Tuesday 15th, there were 3 lightening talks. </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Book club</strong> was about a guy at sky who met with his team of 4 other scrummasters to discuss a chapter each week, generally books about agile. This seemed a really interesting and useful idea.
        <br>
        <strong>Long sprints</strong> (6 weeks) for the regression testing team seemed symptomatic of issues with using scrum, issues with the business structure, and slow testing.
        <br>
        <strong>M is for MVP</strong> described the troubles and ambiguity of MVP (minimum viable product) for those unaccustomed to short releases. There was warning from experience that some stakeholders will want all their features in because they might expect to wait a year before their next opportunity.
