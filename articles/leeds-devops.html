    <h2>Leeds DevOps Jul 2019</h2>
    <li>15/08/2019</li>
    <p>
      We had 2 speakers at DevOps this month, James Scanlan from the NHS Digital Digital Delivery Centre, and Tim Edmonds
      from Accenture/Channel 4.
      <br>
      I know James from my previous work at NHSD. His talk was fairly informal and focussed on the importance of Culture in
      the workplace. Having worked in the environment James described and experiencing the challenges and benefits
      associated with the culture I didn’t take away so much from the presentation, but he had some good references.
      <br>
      The talk from Tim Edmonds about the challenges delivering content for Channel 4’s digital video streaming platform was
      very interesting. His team had a strong focus experimentation; it was interesting to see the modifications they had
      made in the speed at which they loaded different components of the Channel 4 On Demand service homepage.
