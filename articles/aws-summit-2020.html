    <h2>AWS Summit June 2020</h2>
    <li>18/06/2020</li>
    <p>
      Yesterday (17th June) I attended the AWS Summit Online for Europe, Middle East & Africa. The event was bookended by
      talks from CTO Dr. Werner Vogels and CEO Andy Jassy. I was a little disappointed that there were no major
      announcements, but the talks focussed on general positive outcomes for AWS clients.
      <br>
      I chose the ‘I build applications’ track and attended the 5 talks:
      <br>
      Purpose-built databases for modern applications (Level 300)
      This was good revision for the Solutions Architect Certification I’m working on; nothing new though. The talk briefly
      mentions the different database options:
    </p>
    
    <li>Amazon Aurora – SQL</li>
    <li>Amazon DynamoDB – Key/Value</li>
    <li>Amazon DocumentDB – Mongo Compatible</li>
    <li>Amazon ElastiCache – Redis or Memchached (in-memory)</li>
    <li>Amazon Neptune – Graph Database</li>
    <li>Amazon Timestream – Time Series, good for sensor feeds etc.</li>
    <li>Amazon Quantum Ledger Database – a ledger</li>
    <li>Amazon Managed Apache Cassandra Service – wide column</li>
    <p>
      Full-stack mobile and web development with AWS Amplify (Level 300)
      An introduction to Amplify. I’ve not used Amplify but the talk inspired me to follow up with a basic deployment. Lots
      of stuff taken care of for you out of the box. I’m not sure how I feel about this, I like to know a little about how
      everything works in case it goes wrong. Still, looks amazing for prototyping.
      <br>
      Application integration patterns for microservices (Level 300)
      The merits of SNS, SQS, and Step Functions.
      <br>
      Event-driven architecture (Level 300)
      The merits of API Gateway and Event Bridge.
      <br>
      A path to event sourcing with Amazon MSK (Level 200)
      MSK: Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka
      Event sourcing -
      Persist entities by storing a sequence of state-changing events.
      I need to read more on this because it has some relevance for some client work.
      <br>
      Some points on AWS -
      <br>
      Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu all use AWS.
      AWS profit for Q2 this year was $4bn.
      Some sage advice -
      <br>
      Work with lots of experiments with '2-way doors' (decisions you can revert). Think carefully and minimise '1-way
      doors' (decisions which are difficult to revert).
      Speed disproportionately matters.
