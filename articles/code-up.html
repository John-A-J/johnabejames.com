    <h2>Code Up Leeds Jan 2019</h2>
    <li>19/01/2019</li>
    <p>As a break from our usual approach of providing tech classes, this Code Up featured several talks by people who had
      switch careers into software development. I was first up and delivered a talk on my previous life as a transport
      planner, and my transition. The talk went well but I got a couple of pieces of feedback for future presentations.
      <br>
      I said “yeah” to fill gaps. I have been working on reducing the number of times I say “umm” during presentations so
      this is an interesting manifestation. However I definitely hope to address it and just keep the silent breaks in the
      future.
      <br>
      I often stood with one hand on one hip. I didn’t realise I was doing this, but the “I’m a little teapot” look is
      definitely not something I’m aiming for.
      <br>
      Beforehand I joked about the talk being great because it was about me. It concerns me in hindsight that I might look
      arrogant.
